## Description

This project takes an HTML file with an unknown number of text sections and dynamically makes a navigation bar at the top using JavaScript.

It also tracks where the user is scrolling on the page, and highlights the active text section and the active navigation button.

The project is made for [_Udacity_](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [**Front End Web Developer Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

## Features
1.  Dynamic section creation
2.  Dynamic menu
3.  Smooth Scrolling.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
